After a few years on the backburner, we're finally moving the Recipe Book up to a low simmer. We're back with a slew of updates like HTTPS, live search, new recipes, and this blog!

A quick runthough the new goodness:

- HTTPS for [yokobosky.com] is now enabled by default, thanks to recent changes to the hosting site.
- A simple live search is now available at [/search](/search). It indexes the recipe title and the ingredients (so you could find stuffed peppers by searching either "pepper" or "goat cheese").

New features hopefully coming in the next few weeks:


I'll try to post some updates on new projects soon, and I'm always looking for feedback. Until then, happy cooking!
