ingredients:
- 2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 large egg, beaten


directions:
- Add the flour and salt to a large bowl
- Whisk to combine
- In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup water and the butter over medium-high until butter is melted, about 3 minutes.
- Pour the buttery liquid into the flour gradually, stirring it in as you add it. 
- The dough will be quite crumbly and flaky at this point, like a biscuit dough.
- Stir in the egg until combined then move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover the dough with a dampened towel or plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
